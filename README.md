# Portfolio-Optimization-using-Reinforcement-Learning

Portfolio Weight Optimization (PO) Project Summary:

- **Date:** May 2023, **Location:** University at Buffalo, Reinforcement Learning
- **Objective:** Developed a Reinforcement Learning-based portfolio optimization solution to maximize Return on Investment by dynamically adjusting asset weights in response to market trends and anomalies.

- **Environment Creation:** Created a custom environment from scratch, incorporating financial market information, to facilitate RL training.

- **Model Training:** Trained an Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) model from scratch using real-time Yahoo Finance data, achieving a Sharpe ratio of approximately 1.02 during testing.

- **Comparison Analysis:** Conducted a comparative analysis with traditional strategies, including Uniform Portfolio and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio, showcasing the adaptability of the RL agent.

- **Results:** Demonstrated the effectiveness of RL in portfolio optimization and the potential for extended use in varying market conditions and asset portfolios.
